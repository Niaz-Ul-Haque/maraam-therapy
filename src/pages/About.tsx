              We are mosaics of the people around us, the ideas we touch, and the events that we experience. 
              Which brings us to become a part of the mosaic of the human race. Everything you feel is valid. 
              It can be beautiful, but it can also become a difficult sentence when caught in patterns of difficulty.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Pride month has always been something of awe for me. To be celebrating and calling people in 
              from various walks of life, to just be simply human. I remember when I was younger, my first 
              personal call in to my own sexuality was my 8th grade teacher asking me if I had ever thought 
              about my sexuality. She asked me very open-ended-ly and said that whatever it is, it's okay. 
              I don't even remember what I said or did to elicit the conversation, but it was probably just me being myself.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I never took her up on it, but I returned to that question in university, when more friends 
              started to ask me again: had I thought about my sexuality and gender? I finally asked myself 
              and found answers, with the help of learning about history, connecting with media and authors 
              who wrote under pen names to share their stories.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Since I crossed that gap, I, myself, see so many more people connecting to themselves and others. 
              We can only meet each other as far as we meet ourselves, and I am so grateful to the people 
              who called me in to who I truly am.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Now, 8 years after asking myself some open-ended, open-minded, and open-hearted questions, 
              I am grateful for the connections I can have with people and my communities that are so 
              fulfilling and aligned with our truth. I am eternally grateful for the awareness and curiosity 
              of my loved ones, chosen family, and community, who just saw certain parts of my personal 
              mosaic and called me in to realize more about myself.

              My clinical focus is on those who experience <strong>anxiety, self-esteem challenges</strong> and 
              struggle to embody a lot of their emotional experience. These experiences are deeply personal 
              to people, and I see a wide spectrum of unique folks who face a few core issues: chronic 
              challenges and neglect that have led them to prioritize others first.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              As someone who faces these challenges personally, I can be confident, outspoken, and very involved. 
              But there are also times when I struggle to uphold meaningful relationships, roles, and day-to-day 
              tasks that are expected of me, and I can imagine the relief of crawling into a shell. There is a 
              large range in how such personal and deep challenges may present.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              It may be challenging to hold experiences that carry vulnerability in a meaningful or safe way. 
              Understanding ourselves without judgement, with an open-minded curiosity, can get us much closer 
              to ourselves and meeting our needs in an informed, direct, meaningful and sustainable way. By 
              learning to appreciate past methods of coping, we can also develop new skills to live in a more 
              integrated and holistic way.
